		<div class="flex-itemABOUTcreator2">Born 1974. How awesome is that.</div>

		<div class="flex-itemABOUT1">
			<img src="images/P-BIRD_text.png" height="10%" width="100%" alt=""/>
			<img src="images/P-BIRD_image.png" height="45%" width="100%" alt=""/>P-Bird is sweet, good-natured and wants no harm. However, he is also gullible in matters he doesn’t quite grasp and succumbs easily to dumb ideas from any sort of authority. Therefore, P-Bird is often the victim.</div>
		<div class="flex-itemABOUT2">
			<img src="images/LLP-DUDE_text.png" height="10%" width="100%" alt=""/>
			<img src="images/LLP_image.png" height="45%" width="100%" alt=""/>LLP-Dude is a bona fide intellectual-yet-idiot. He is well-educated, theoretical and lacks no scruples. His attitude towards work can best be defined as nonchalant. That’s because everything goes through his limited liability partnership (LLP), which is a corporate vehicle permitting shoddy work without fear of any retribution from the authorities.  </div>
		<div class="flex-itemABOUT3">
			<img src="images/ROBOADVISOR_text.png" height="10%" width="100%" alt=""/>
			<img src="images/ROBOADVISOR_image.png" height="45%" width="100%" alt=""/>Roboadvisor has no regard for anyone’s feelings. He works in the bank with Reto und Urs to lure the digitally inclined clientele, who value price over quality. Hence, Roboadvisor is programmed to be selfish with a hint of analytical reasoning capabilities.</div>
		<div class="flex-itemABOUT4">
			<img src="images/RETOUNDURS_text.png" height="10%" width="100%" alt=""/>
			<img src="images/RETO UND URS_image.png" height="45%" width="100%" alt=""/>Reto und Urs are two regular offshore bankers. Reto has hair, Urs not so much. Their speciality is hiding undeclared loot from the tax authorities. That’s it. Reto is the smarter one of the two, which doesn’t mean much, and Urs is generally clueless …especially regarding women, life or common sense.</div>
		<div class="flex-itemABOUT5">
			<img src="images/WEASEL_Text.png" height="10%" width="100%" alt=""/>
			<img src="images/WEASEL_image.png" height="45%" width="100%" alt=""/>Markets-Weasel is the ruthlessly selfish investment banker. He always pitches an attractive sounding “investment opportunity” (usually in the form of structured products), which eventually turn out to be detrimental for P-Bird.</div>
		<div class="flex-itemABOUT6">
			<img src="images/COMPLIANCE_text.png" height="10%" width="100%" alt=""/>
			<img src="images/COMPLIANCE OFFIZIER_image.png" height="45%" width="100%" alt=""/>Compliance Offizier is a deranged psycho, who dumps and enforces mercilessly any new regulations upon the helpless bankers. He is generally useless but can nevertheless do whatever pleases him because within the bank he’s an “untouchable”.</div>
		<div class="flex-itemABOUT7">
			<img src="images/HFT_text.png" height="10%" width="100%" alt=""/>
			<img src="images/HFT_image.png" height="45%" width="100%" alt=""/> Fund Manager is a simple-minded, hedonistic high-frequency-trader (HFT), who occasionally masquerades as a hedge fund manager (HFM). His underlying motive is to get more while giving less in return, or failing at that, to outright steal your money. </div>
